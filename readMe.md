# CPU Scheduling Simulator in C++

This project simulates major CPU scheduling algorithms from Operating Systems. It helps analyze how different schedulers affect process execution times using a Gantt chart and performance metrics.

## Features

- ✅ First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- ✅ Shortest Job First (SJF) – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive
- ✅ Priority Scheduling – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive
- ✅ Round Robin Scheduling (with time quantum)
- ✅ Gantt Chart-style Output
- ✅ Calculates:
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Response Time
